### Project 1: Search 
 - In this project, Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.
- Applied search algorithms: DFS, BFS, UCS, A*, Suboptimal Search, Heuristic functions

### Project 2 - Adversarial Search
- In this project, you will design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, you will implement both minimax and expectimax search and try your hand at evaluation function design.
- Topics covered: Minimax, Expectimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Evaluation function

### Project 3 - Markov Decision Process and Reinforcement Learning
- In this project, you will implement value iteration and Q-learning. You will test your agents first on Gridworld (from class), then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.
- Topics covered: Value Iteration, Policies, Q-learning, Epsilon Greedy
