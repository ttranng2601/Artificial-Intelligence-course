### Course Description:
This course introduces fundamental knowledge for designing an intelligent and autonomous agent who lives in an environment with fully observable or partially observable settings and with/without adversarial agents and the agent needs to make decision to reach its goal or accomplish its mission (e.g., maximize its score). Each autonomous system has three main modules of perception, planning, and control, The focus of the course is topics on planning/decision making as well as agent’s perception (learning based methods and statistical methods). The course also introduces basics topics on computer vision, self-driving cars and game theory.
### Topics:
- Search techniques for an intelligent agent with and without adversary agent (e.g., A*, DFS, BFS, UCP)
- Decision making and planning in fully observable and partially observable environments (MDP, POMDP)
- Machine learning basics focus on Logistic regression and Naïve Bayes, statistical learning and HMM
- Particle Filtering
- Convolutional Neural Networks: basics and applications
- Introduction to other Deep Learning Models: Autoencoders
- Imitation learning and Reinforcement Learning
- AI for self-driving cars
- AI for Games
- AI for computer vision
